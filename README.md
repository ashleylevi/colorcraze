# **Colorcraze**

### About
* Colorcraze is a full stack application that allows users to create a group of five colors generated via hex code. Individual colors can be locked in and randomization repeated until a desireable palette is found. Palettes can then be saved into individual projects, recalled later, and deleted.

### Tech Stack
* All data for this application is stored in a custom backend database built using Express, PostgreSQL, and Knex utilizing REST API.
* Front-end was built in vanilla JavaScript.

Colorcraze is deployed to Heroku and can be found at: https://colorcraze.herokuapp.com/

### Local Setup:
To view this application, you first need to run the backend server by following these instructions (the front end will run after the backend starts off of a static public file):

clone down the repository
cd into directory

run `$ npm install`

run `npm install nodemon`

run `nodemon server.js`

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
